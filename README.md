# Rail Analysis and Management System  

The **Rail Analysis and Management System** is a robust application designed to simplify and streamline railway operations, including schedule management, ticket booking, and user feedback collection. Built with Python and PyQt5 (PySide2), it features an intuitive GUI and implements advanced data structures and algorithms for efficient operations.  

## üåü Key Features  

### 1. **User Authentication and Signup**  
- **Secure Credentials**: User credentials are encrypted using the bcrypt library and stored in a local CSV database.  
- **Unique Identification**: Ensures unique usernames and email addresses to maintain secure user accounts.  

### 2. **Google Sign-In Integration**  
- **Convenience**: Seamless integration of Google sign-in via OAuth2.0 for quick and secure access.  
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Ensures a smooth and responsive user experience.  

### 3. **Railway Schedule Management**  
- **Dynamic Linked List**: Efficiently organizes railway schedules from the "Train and Time.csv" file.  
- **Interactive UI**: Includes sortable tables and dynamic combo boxes for user-friendly schedule filtering and exploration.  

### 4. **Booking Confirmation**  
- **Constraint Verification**: Verifies valid start and end locations to prevent invalid bookings.  
- **Transparent Pricing**: Automatically calculates ticket prices based on selected options.  

### 5. **Graph Visualization**  
- **NetworkX and Matplotlib**: Visualizes railway routes and connections using graph data from "graphAttributes.txt."  
- **Intuitive Representation**: Provides clear and interactive graph-based insights.  

### 6. **User Feedback Collection**  
- **Stack Implementation**: Stores user feedback in a stack structure, saved to "feedback.txt" for future analysis.  
- **Long-Term Accessibility**: Ensures organized and persistent feedback management.
